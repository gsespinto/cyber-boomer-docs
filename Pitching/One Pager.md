**Version:** 0.1 (04/12/2025)

**Game Name:** Cyber/Boomer (WIP)

**Core concept:**
	- In this fast-paced, rhythm-based game, you navigate through timed levels, unlocking new weapons and passive abilities as you progress. Each weapon and ability is triggered automatically in sync with the music beats, adding an extra layer of strategy and immersion. Throughout the level, swarms of enemies relentlessly pursue you, and at key moments, intense boss battles challenge your skills. When the player dies or the timer runs out, the level ends. However, some of the currency earned carries over, allowing you to unlock new perks and starting loadouts for future runs. Once you've mastered a level, the next stage is unlocked, introducing fresh enemy types and new challenges to conquer.

**Genre:** Vampire Survivors-like, FPS, Rogue-lite

**Platforms:** PC, Mobile, Nintendo Switch, VR (?)
