**Analysis:**
Dead Cells serves as a strong visual and technical reference for our project. The game uses 3D renders for its main character, enemies, and props, achieving a fluid, detailed animation style that maintains a distinct hand-crafted feel. This aligns closely with our intended approach, as we also aim to use 3D-rendered assets stylized to fit within a pixel-art or low-resolution aesthetic. The result is both visually rich and production-efficient, offering a great balance between style and practicality.
The color palette in Dead Cells is vivid and expressive, similar to the vibrant tones seen in [[Warhammer 40,000 Boltgun]]. The heavy use of saturated hues and contrasting lighting creates a sense of energy and atmosphere even during chaotic gameplay. This is an important consideration for our art direction, especially as we explore how color and lighting can define mood and help with gameplay readability.
The game launched first on PC and contemporary consoles, later expanding to mobile and newer-generation systems. This phased rollout allowed the developers to build a solid player base and refine the experience before porting it to other platforms. While this differs from [[Vampire Survivors]]’ simultaneous cross-platform strategy, it highlights an alternative model: focusing first on a polished core version before expanding to reach wider audiences.
