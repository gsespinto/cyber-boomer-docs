**Analysis:**
There’s a lot to learn from Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun, starting with its visuals. The game features rich, crunchy pixel art enhanced by excellent use of particle effects, post-processing, and color. While our game will lean more toward a cyberpunk aesthetic, and therefore use a different color palette, we can still take inspiration from Boltgun’s stylized use of post-processing, specifically how it tints shadows and highlights to create visual depth and mood.
Given our resource limitations, we’ll likely take a different approach to enemy design. Instead of traditional pixel art sprites, our enemies will be pixel-art-style billboards generated from renders of 3D models at a low enough resolution to achieve a pixelated look, like in [[Dead Cells]]. While this method sacrifices some control over animation precision, it allows us to produce a wider variety of enemies and leverage our team’s strengths in 3D modeling.
The gunplay in Boltgun feels exceptional, each weapon is responsive, powerful, and visually impactful. We’ll aim for a similar level of responsiveness, especially for our special abilities triggered by QTEs, since our standard weapons and abilities will auto-trigger. Like Boltgun, we’ll use projectile-based attacks instead of pure raycasting. Projectiles provide better visual feedback through trails and motion, enhancing both clarity and style.
In Boltgun, enemies detect, follow, and attack the player dynamically, with impressive traversal behavior. Some enemies fly, others use melee or ranged attacks. Our design will adapt this by having an infinite-plane level (inspired by [[Vampire Survivors]]), where enemies always know the player’s position and continuously move toward them to attack. We’ll include both flying and ground-based enemies, as well as melee and
ranged variants.
Finally, similar to [[Vampire Survivors]], each stage will culminate in a boss battle. These bosses will feature more complex behavior patterns (potentially including multiple phases or attack stages) like the bosses in Boltgun, to create a satisfying challenge and sense of progression.
