**Analysis:**
This game is the primary inspiration and reference for our project. With its tight and polished gameplay loop, it’s almost impossible to resist jumping into another 20-minute run immediately after dying.
Our goal is to replicate that sense of flow. The player begins each run with a basic weapon and an upgrade specific to their initial build. Over time, they enhance their build’s passives and abilities by acquiring new weapons and gear upgrades.
Each weapon or ability in Vampire Survivors activates automatically, allowing players to focus mainly on positioning and avoiding enemies. Since our game will be an FPS, we need to ensure that movement feels smooth and intuitive so players aren’t overwhelmed while facing large hordes of enemies. To add more active gameplay, we plan to include a special ability that requires precise player input to trigger, such as a QTE.
Another key element to draw from is the use of RNG. Beyond simply ensuring that each run feels different, Vampire Survivors incorporates exciting visual and audio effects when players obtain new abilities. These
moments, reminiscent of slot machines or other iGaming elements, create strong dopamine hits mid-gameplay. To capture that feeling, our game should include highly satisfying sound design and visuals
for obtaining weapons and abilities. For example, the game could briefly freeze as a mystical crate descends from the sky, and the reveal interface could resemble CS:GO’s crate opening UI.
In Vampire Survivors, each ability feels unique, both in gameplay and visually, making them instantly recognizable. We’ll need to achieve a similar level of distinction for our weapons and abilities. However, since an FPS can easily become visually cluttered, we’ll emphasize sound design over excessive visual effects to help differentiate weapons and abilities without overwhelming the player.
Finally, a notable marketing strategy from Vampire Survivors was its simultaneous release on PC and mobile, with the PC version as a premium purchase and the mobile version free with ads and microtransactions.
This approach allowed players to experience the core gameplay loop on mobile first and then purchase the full version on PC if they enjoyed it. Although our game would not integrate so well with the free mobile market, being an FPS, we could also have a discounted premium mobile version. No microtransations or ads, just an extra possible revenue source for an audience that is already familiarized with Vampire Survivors.
