**Version:** 0.1 (04/12/2025)

**Game Name:** Cyber/Boomer (WIP)

**Core concept:**
	- You play in timed levels, while unlocking new weapons, passive abilities and upgrading these. The weapons and abilities auto trigger according to the music beats. Swarms of enemies chase you and, at specific times, boss battles occur. Once the player dies or the timer runs out, the level ends. Some currency gained from the level remains for the player to unlock new perks and starting loadouts. After being able to complete the level to the end or a certain amount of hidden XP is achieved, the next level is unlocked with new enemy types.

**Genre:** Vampire Survivors-like, FPS, Rogue-lite
